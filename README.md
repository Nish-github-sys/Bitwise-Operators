# Bitwise-Operators
Aim: To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators

Tools Used: VS Code or Programiz Online Compiler

Theory: -->Program-1: This program demonstrates various bitwise operations in C++. Bitwise operators perform operations on the binary representations of integers at the bit level.

1. Bitwise AND (&): Performs a logical AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits
2. Bitwise OR (|): Performs a logical OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits
3. Bitwise NOT (~): Performs a logical NOT operation on each bit (flips all bits)
4. Bitwise XOR (^): Performs an exclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits
5. Left Shift (<<): Shifts all bits to the left by the specified number of positions
6. Right Shift (>>): Shifts all bits to the right by the specified number of positions


-->Program-2: This program accepts marks for five subjects, calculates the average, and assigns a grade based on the average score.

->The program takes input for five subjects: DCLD, NT, EDC, SnS, and MTT. ->It calculates the average by adding all subject marks and dividing by 5. ->Based on the average, it assigns grades using if-else conditions as follows: O Grade: 90–100 A+ Grade: 80–89 A Grade: 70–79 B Grade: 60–69 C Grade: 50–59 FAIL: Below 50 ->If the calculated average is outside 0–100, it displays an error message to enter valid marks.

-->Program-3: This program identifies the position of a point (x, y) in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system based on its x and y coordinates.

->The program takes two integer inputs: x-coordinate and y-coordinate. ->It then uses if-else conditions to determine the point's location: 1st Quadrant: x > 0 and y > 0. 2nd Quadrant: x < 0 and y > 0. 3rd Quadrant: x < 0 and y < 0. 4th Quadrant: x > 0 and y < 0. On X-axis: y = 0 and x ≠ 0. On Y-axis: x = 0 and y ≠ 0. At Origin: x = 0 and y = 0. ->The program prints the appropriate message indicating the point’s position.

Conclusion: Hence, we used the Bitwise Operators for performing
